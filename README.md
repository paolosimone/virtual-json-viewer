# Virtual Json Viewer

Browser plugin that uses [virtual DOM](https://github.com/Lodin/react-vtree) to render JSONs with built-in search, [JQ filtering](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)* and many other [features](#features).

_*Coming soon_

# Why?

> "Oh my! There are plenty of json viewers, why making a new one?"

Rightful question, and the answer is quite simple: the others weren't good enough [for my needs].  
I am a backend developer and in my everyday job I have to debug large json payloads, 
so large that every other plugin for chrome I tried freezed without showing any content.

> "Good for you, but **my** payloads are small, pretty and strawberry flavoured"

That's ok, if you are satisfied by your current plugin, no need to change.  
And if you want to come back later don't worry, we'll still be here, with blazing fast loading time, 
built-in search, JQ filtering and many other features... but no strawberries, sorry
