# Virtual Json Viewer

Browser plugin that uses [virtual DOM](https://github.com/Lodin/react-vtree) to render JSONs with built-in search, [JQ filtering](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) and many other [features](#features).

## Why?

> "Oh my! There are plenty of json viewers, why making a new one?"

Rightful question, and the answer is quite simple: the others weren't good enough [for my needs].  

I am a backend developer and in my everyday job I have to debug large json payloads, 
so large that every other plugin for chrome I tried freezed without showing any content.

> "Good for you, but **my** payloads are small, pretty and strawberry flavoured"

That's ok, if you are happy with your current plugin, no need to change.  

And if you want to come back later don't worry, we'll still be here, with blazing fast loading time, 
built-in search, JQ filtering and many other features... but no strawberries, sorry

## Performance

*Disclaimer*: this is NOT a formal benchmark, just a few tests with syntethic data to give an idea of loading performance time.

**Setup**
- Macbook Pro 16 (2019) 2,6 GHz 16 GB
- Chrome 95.0.4638.69
- Jsons are randomly generated using [this script](https://gist.github.com/paolosimone/437ba2e9675bafcc914b587d53fab0b3) (fixed dept: 10)
- Files are loaded from disk
- Load time recorded with Chrome DevTool
    1. Open file in chrome
    1. Click "Start profiling and reload page" 
    1. Take the end of the last frame 

**Results**

| Siblings per level | File Size      | Load time       |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 110                | ~100 KB        | ~250 ms         |
| 1100               | ~1 MB          | ~350 ms         |
| 11000              | ~10 MB         | ~1200 ms        |
| 110000             | ~100 MB        | ~10 s           |
