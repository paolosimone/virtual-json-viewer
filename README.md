# ![logo](extension/public/logo/48.png) Virtual Json Viewer

Browser plugin that uses [virtual DOM](https://github.com/Lodin/react-vtree) to render JSONs with built-in search, JQ filtering and many other [features](#features).

## Browser Store

[![chrome](assets/badge-chrome.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtual-json-viewer/cipnpfcceoapeahdgomheoecidglopld) [![firefox](assets/badge-firefox.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/virtual-json-viewer/)

### Manifest Version

The default build for Chrome relies on the new [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) and requires Chromium version 106 or higher.  
If you are running an older version of Chromium because reasons... I got your back!
Simpy follow the instructions on how to perform a [manual installation](#manual-installation) using a MV2 release.

## Why?

> "Oh my! There are plenty of json viewers, why making a new one?"

Rightful question, and the answer is quite simple: the others weren't good enough [for my needs].  

I often have to debug large json payloads, so large that every other plugin for chrome I tried freezed without showing any content.

> "Good for you, but **my** payloads are small, pretty and strawberry flavoured"

That's ok, if you are happy with your current plugin, no need to change.  

And if you want to come back later don't worry, we'll still be here, with blazing fast loading time, 
built-in search, JQ filtering and many other features... but no strawberries, sorry

## FAQ

### Why the extension doesn't work when opening a file from filesystem?

On Chrome

1. go to `chrome://extensions/`
1. select "Virtual Json Viewer" 
1. enable the toggle "Allow access to file URLs"

If this doesn't solve the issue make sure you are using the latest version of both Chrome and Virtual Json Viewer, or manually install the [correct build for your version](#manual-installation).

### Why JQ is not available?

[JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) has been [compiled to WebAssembly](https://github.com/paolosimone/jq-wasm) and included in this plugin, but some website's Content Security Policy doesn't allow WASM execution. In those cases the JQ command bar is not shown.

_Example:_ https://api.github.com/users/paolosimone/repos

See also [Issue #15](https://github.com/paolosimone/virtual-json-viewer/issues/15)


### Why this valid JQ command doesn't work?

[JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) commands in Virtual Json Viewer must return valid json, otherwise the parsing of the result will fail with an error e.g.

> Unexpected token { in JSON at position 337

Why? The core feature of Virtual Json Viewer is the navigation of (possibly large) json thanks to virtual DOM that allows on-demand rendering. JQ filtering has been added on top of that, just as handy utilities to further improve the user experience.

_Example_

Let's say we want to extract all the page titles from this [Wikipedia search](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&srsearch=pizza&utf8=&format=json).

`.query.search[].title` will fail because a sequence of strings is not a valid json:
```text
"Pizza"
"Hawaiian pizza üò±"
"History of pizza"
"Pizza Margherita"
...
```

We should use `.query.search | map(.title)` instead to obtain a json array:
```json
[
  "Pizza",
  "Hawaiian pizza üò±",
  "History of pizza",
  "Pizza Margherita",
  ...
]
```

ok ok, I added the scream emoji

## Manual Installation

### Get the build

> I'm confused, which manifest version should I get?

| Browser        | Manifest |
|----------------|:--------:|
| Chrome 106+    |   V3     |
| Chrome (older) |   V2     |
| Firefox        |   V2     |

*Note:* the only differences are in the manifest. The underlying extension code is the same for all builds

#### From Release

Download the latest build from the [release page](https://github.com/paolosimone/virtual-json-viewer/releases) and extract the content

- `virtual-json-viewer-{version}`: Chrome manifest V3
- `virtual-json-viewer-{version}-mv2`: Chrome manifest V2
- `virtual-json-viewer-{version}-firefox`: Firefox (manifest V2)

#### From source

```bash
cd extension
yarn install

yarn build          # Chrome  - Manifest V3
yarn build-mv2      # Chrome  - Manifest V2
yarn build-firefox  # Firefox - Manifest V2
```

### Install the extension

#### Chrome

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`
1. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode
1. Click the load unpacked button and select the `build` directory

#### Firefox

Disable native json viewer

1. Go to `about:config`
1. Search for `devtools.jsonview.enabled`
1. Set to false

Load extension

1. Go to `about:debugging`
1. Click "This Firefox"
1. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the `build` directory

*Note:* The extension is automatically removed when Firefox is closed and must be manually loaded on next start.

#### Others

The extension has not been tested on other browsers, but should work on any chromium browser.

## Contributing

### Bug fix

Ooops! Just [open an issue](https://github.com/paolosimone/virtual-json-viewer/issues/new) with detailed description of what happened and how to reproduce it... Or go for it and open a PR with the patch if you are brave enough!

### Feature request

In general I'd rather keep the feature set of Virtual Json Viewer small and well defined, but if you have a proposal feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/paolosimone/virtual-json-viewer/issues/new) and we will discuss it.

### Translation

New languages are welcome, open a PR and follow these steps.

Translation files are in json format (yo dawg!) and are located in the translation folder `extension/src/viewer/localization/translations`.

To add a new language:

1. Make a copy of the `en.json` translation file and rename it with the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) two-letter code of the new language (e.g. `es.json` for Spanish)
1. Translate all the values in the new translation file
1. Register the new language by adding it to the enum (and other structures) inside `extension/src/viewer/localization/Localization.ts`

## Local development

Run `yarn start` to serve the extension as a web app with hot reload.

Always `yarn format` before creating a commit.

## Performance

*Disclaimer*: this is NOT a formal benchmark, just a few tests with syntethic data to give an idea of loading performance time.

**Setup**
- Virtual Json Viewer v1.0.0 
- Macbook Pro 16 (2019) 2,6 GHz 16 GB
- Chrome 106.0.5249.119 
- Jsons are randomly generated using [this script](https://gist.github.com/paolosimone/437ba2e9675bafcc914b587d53fab0b3) (fixed dept: 10)
- Files are loaded from disk
- Load time recorded with Chrome DevTool
    1. Open file in chrome
    1. From "Performance insights" tab click "Measure page load"
    1. Take the "Largest Contentful Paint" (LCP)

**Results**

| Siblings per level | File Size      | Load time       |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 110                | ~100 KB        | ~300 ms         |
| 1100               | ~1 MB          | ~350 ms         |
| 11000              | ~10 MB         | ~900 ms         |
| 110000             | ~100 MB        | ~8000 ms        |
